This is what the command line interface looks like (you won't have those commands of course, they're admin-only)(modificato)
And to use it, you have to inject "LuaLinkerClient.dll" into the game client (Elsword, Closers, SoulWorker, whatever. Works on many games)
To execute Lua scripts, load "ExecutorPlugin.dll" (with "loadplugin")
With ExecutorPlugin, you can type
plugin help

to get a list of supported commands.
"DumperPlugin.dll" allows you to read all Lua files the game client loads. It will put them into a directory called "luadumps" by default which has to exist in the game's working directory.
You can change this directory by using this command when DumperPlugin is loaded:
plugin "C:\path\to\directory\"
It is important to add another backslash at the end of the path.(modificato)
"StandaloneLauncher.exe" allows you to connect to the LuaLinker server and see how much usage time you have left with the "timeleft" command.
(You can't use the "utimeleft" command like I did. That's for admins only and allows me to see how much time any user has left.)
("user time left")(modificato)
If you want to see the full list of supported commands, type "commands".
If you want to see how to use a certain command, type "help <name of command>".
Example:
> commands
accountid help sessions createaccount utimeleft addtime sessioncount timeleft shutdown commands
Type 'help <command>' for help about a specific command.
> help addtime
Adds usage time to an account.
Arguments: <account id> <seconds>

This program is extremely complicated to use - good luck with it.
By the way, I also included the source code of "ExecutorPlugin.dll" and "DumperPlugin.dll", so if anything is unclear, take a look at those.
And I only gave you 10 hours for now, so after you've used the program for 10 hours, it'll stop working.
